							The Vietnamese-German University (VGU) is a Vietnamese state university. Founded in 2008, VGU is based on a close cooperation between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the German State Hessen. Within the past years the project broadened to a German-wide cooperation.
							<br><br>
							Our goal is to build a research-oriented university of world standard in Ho-Chi-Minh City. Being a joint effort of Vietnamese and German institutions, we follow the successful German model and standards concerning our academic and administrative structure.
							<br><br>
							VGU's strategy is to import excellent German study programs, taken from the strongest engineering areas of Germany and customize them to the needs of Vietnamese higher education. While being in a transitional phase, our study programs are run by German partner universities which ensure their high quality by sending experienced professors from Germany. After a successful study students receive a German university degree, providing them with best opportunities on the job-market.
							<br><br>
							Given the mission by the Vietnamese government, VGU aims to become the leading research university in Vietnam and the region. Focusing on High-Tech Engineering and Sustainable Development, we seek to train excellent academics and to provide ample qualification to Vietnamese university lecturers, so they can compete on an international level.  
							<br><br>
							VGU's profile is unique: German study programs and German degrees provide for an exceptional education of highest standards. That's why studying at VGU ensures best opportunities on the job-market - we make it possible for students to benefit from excellent study programs and to succeed on an internationally competitive level.
